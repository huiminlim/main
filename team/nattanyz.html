<p>FlashCard Pro is an application designed for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing flashcards. It is optimised for users who are comfortable with Command Line Interface-based interaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FlashCard Pro has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added the <strong>ability for user to view their statistics</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allows the user to see their <strong>past login sessions</strong>, <strong>total duration spent in the app</strong>, and their <strong>test sessions involving each deck</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More detailed statistics are also provided, allowing the user to drill down into a granular view of their activity, e.g. login sessions by week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user can also see their <strong>statistics by deck</strong>, which is useful if they want to gauge how much time they&#8217;re spending reviewing each subject. The <strong>average score</strong> for test sessions conducted on the deck is also provided, giving the user feedback on their performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This feature improves the product by allowing the user to reflect on their activity in the app, and whether the time spent was productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can also see their improvement over time and feel encouraged by it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement required some degree of analysis of how the application handles various commands, in particular the startup and shutdown of the application, in order to time the duration of each login session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additions to the  <code>Storage</code> component and learning to use Haliq&#8217;s JSON storage features were required to store and load the <code>SessionList</code> objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My team&#8217;s decision to make <code>State</code> non-static influenced me to decouple <code>UserStats</code> from <code>State</code>. This required some degree of refactoring quite close to the deadline of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get aggregate data from <code>LocalDateTime</code> and <code>Duration</code> objects, I implemented a number of utilities in the <code>DateTimeUtil</code> class (and some others). The process of writing and testing these utilities was quite enjoyable and increased my confidence in working with Java APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: contributions to the GUI of the app.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What I&#8217;ve done:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was initially responsible for building and maintaining GUI of the app. The GUI I had envisioned was much simpler and had a custom layout&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;conceptualised in Figma, then built from scratch. It did not use the MVC pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it was for the better that our team eventually decided to move on to an MVC-based GUI. This allowed us to focus on building the happy path of the app, before working on integrating the GUI and CLI, then making various cosmetic improvements. This new version of the GUI was authored by Timothy (hence, it is no longer my main feature), but I have still made a number of improvements since.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planned future enhancements:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>From my first baby steps in working with GUIs during the individual project, I can safely say that I have learnt a great deal since. In particular, I am now more familiar with the JavaFX library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can now build a JavaFX GUI (albeit a simpler one) programmatically, without using SceneBuilder, as I have done in the earlier stages of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can also author new components via SceneBuilder (such as <code>StatisticsWindow</code>) and make significant changes to existing components (such as <code>MainWindow</code> and the various displays). By referring to the API, I was able to overcome a number of challenges to achieve my desired behaviour (e.g. components being laid out with appropriate padding, preserving the size and scale of components when the window is resized).</p>

<li>
<p>I authored the Introduction section of the User Guide, as I was quite involved in the initial conceptualisation of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, I made non-trivial improvements to the clarity of the writing throughout the User Guide. In particular, I abstracted out the What is a flashcard? and Interacting with flashcards sections from the Introduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also helped to clean up various sections of the User Guide, especially in the first draft, to make sure they abided by a consistent format.</p>

<p>FlashCard Pro is an application designed for students who <strong>prefer to use a desktop app for managing flashcards</strong>. It is also useful for teachers who would like to provide resources, in the form of custom flashcard decks, to support their students’ learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FlashCard Pro is optimised for users who are <strong>comfortable with Command Line Interface-based interaction</strong>, allowing them to work more efficiently than with traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based flashcard apps, while still being able to use their flashcards in a familiar GUI format.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="what-is-a-flashcard"><a class="link" href="#what-is-a-flashcard">What is a flashcard?</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Flashcards</strong> are containers for information. Each card has a “front” and a “back”. One recommended use case is such: the user stores a question on the “front” of the card, and the answer on the “back”.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="interacting-with-flashcards"><a class="link" href="#interacting-with-flashcards">Interacting with flashcards</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After sets of flashcards (known as <strong>“decks”</strong>) have been created, the user can interact with the flashcards in various ways. For example, they may test themselves on the content of the decks via <strong>timed and untimed tests</strong>. For ordinary cards with a front and back, the user can gauge their own understanding of the material by pressing either the "I got it right!" or "I got it wrong :(" buttons on the back of the flashcard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other types of flashcards support more advanced interactions. Cards with <strong>multiple choices</strong> for their answers will prompt the user to select an answer, and the app will automatically determine if the answer is correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of each test, FlashCard Pro will provide the user with a score. Comprehensive <strong>statistics on the user&#8217;s test sessions and login sessions</strong> are recorded, which can be accessed via the Statistics menu in FlashCard Pro. The user may use these statistics to assess the frequency of their usage and their performance over time. Statistics are also provided on each card in a deck, so that the user can identify specific cards they may have problems with [coming in v2.0].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with physical flashcards, the flashcards in FlashCard Pro can be shuffled, used in reverse, mixed between decks, etc [coming in v2.0]. Unlike physical flashcards, flashcards in FlashCard Pro are dynamic, offering a range of possibilities from traditional memorisation-type uses, to support for learning programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With FlashCard Pro&#8217;s <strong>Java and JavaScript cards</strong>, teachers can define basic coding problems for their students. Based on the test cases provided by the teachers, FlashCard Pro will evaluate the output of the student’s solution, allowing students to gauge their own coding knowledge, and teachers to evaluate their students’ progress. Test decks can be passed easily from student to teacher, as they are stored in convenient, lightweight JSON files which can be <strong>imported or exported</strong> natively in FlashCard Pro.</p>
